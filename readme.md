# Data Structures
Data Structures refer to how data is organized

## Operations
- Read
- Search
- Insert
- Delete

## Classification
- Linear: Elements are arranged sequentially
  - Static 
    - Static DS has a fixed memory side
    - It's easier to access the elements in a static DS
    - Example: Array    
  - Dynamic
    - In dynamic DS, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly modified during runtime, which may be considered memory inefficient
    - Example: Queue, Stack, LinkedList
- Non-linear: Elements are not placed sequentially, side by side.
  - Tree
  - Graph

## Array
Array is one of the most basic data structures in CS.

## Linked List
A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Stack
Stacks are a collection that adheres to the last in, first out (LIFO) concept.

## Queue
## Hash Table

## Heap
## Binary Tree
## Binary Search Tree
## Graph
